# Web-Based SQL Management Application

This project involves developing a web application that interfaces with a MySQL database called `project4`. The application consists of multiple user interfaces and servlets that allow users to interact with the database based on their roles.

## Database Schema

The `project4` database contains the following tables:

- **suppliers**: `(snum, sname, status, city)`
- **parts**: `(pnum, pname, color, weight, city)`
- **jobs**: `(jnum, jname, numworkers, city)`
- **shipments**: `(snum, pnum, jnum, quantity)`

### Key Details:
- **Primary Key for shipments**: Composite key of `(snum, pnum, jnum)`.
- **Referential Integrity**: Enforced via foreign key constraints. Shipment records must reference existing suppliers, parts, and jobs.

## Application Overview

### Authentication
- **HTML Landing Page**: Used to authenticate users via a servlet.
- **User Credentials Database**: `credentialsDB` is used for authentication, storing usernames and passwords in the `usercredentials` table.

### User Interfaces

1. **Root-Level User Interface**
   - Allows execution of SQL commands (queries, insert, update, delete).
   - Business logic increases the status of suppliers by 5 if they are involved in shipments with a quantity of 100 or more.
   
2. **Client-Level User Interface**
   - Similar to root-level but without update privileges or business logic.

3. **Data Entry User Interface**
   - Form-based data entry for adding records to the four tables.
   - Uses `preparedStatement` to execute SQL commands in the background.

4. **Accountant-Level User Interface**
   - Provides a selection of reports generated by executing Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) on the server.
   - Uses `CallableStatement` to interact with stored procedures on the database.

### Servlets and Business Logic

- **Root-Level and Data Entry Servlets**: Implement business logic on the server-side. For example, increasing supplier status for certain shipment updates.
- **Client-Level Servlet**: Handles SQL commands without business logic due to limited privileges.
- **Accountant-Level Servlet**: Executes predefined stored procedures based on user selection.

### Front-End and Back-End

- **Front-End**: All user interfaces are built using JSP (JavaServer Pages) technology.
- **Back-End**: The `project4` MySQL database managed by the MySQL DBMS server.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project files to your local machine.
2. **Database Setup**: Run the provided creation/population script to set up the `project4` database.
3. **Configure Properties Files**: Set up connection properties for different user roles.
4. **Deploy to Tomcat**: Deploy the application to a Tomcat server.
5. **Access the Application**: Use a web browser to access the application and authenticate as different users.
